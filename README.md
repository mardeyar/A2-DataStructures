# Data Structures: Nodes
## About
This project is a basic exercise in data structures using nodes and doubly linked lists. Different methods handle finding, adding, removing data from the list.

## How to use
Clone this repo into your local

```git clone https://github.com/mardeyar/A2-DataStructures.git```

Open the project in your IDE and run the program

## How it works
The program runs 10 different methods to view and manipulate the data inside the lists
* **Append**: Appends a new node containing a value to the end of the list if the value is not already present
* **Prepend**: Adds a new node containing the specified value to the start of the list
* **NodeSize**: Finds the total number of nodes in the list
* **NodeHead**: Gets and returns the first node in the list
* **NodeTail**: Get and returns the last node in the list
* **AtPosition**: Gets the node at the passed index value
* **NodePop**: Removes last element from the list
* **NodeContains**: Takes a value to check whether the list contains a node with the given value
* **NodeFind**: Searches the list for a node containing the passed value

The program initializes with random integers on first run so the data is different every time.
